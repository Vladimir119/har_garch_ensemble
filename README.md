# Using Ensembling Techniques To Combine Predictions of HAR and GARCH Models
---
## Overview
This research investigates the use of ensembling techniques to
enhance volatility forecasting in cryptocurrency markets by combining
HAR and GARCH models. HAR-based models generally outperform
GARCH(1,1) and naive models, though the choice of HAR specification is crucial. The main contribution is the novel use of stacking HAR,
GARCH, and Naive models, significantly improving performance. In contrast, attempts to combine HAR and GARCH with ARIMA for residual
prediction failed, as ARIMA couldn’t capture the residuals’ distribution.
This study highlights the potential of stacking HAR and GARCH models, an underexplored area, and suggests further research into refining
stacking methods and exploring advanced residual prediction models.
